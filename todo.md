To do
=====

* Import verbs from that site. Eventually other word forms too.
* * Convert them into that structure
* Optimize so that it doesn't do predicate expansion unless it actually sees a verb or adverb at the start, the only things predicate can expand to.
* When failing to find a string, output the failing string
