To do
=====

* Get more verbs
* Start thinking about nouns, adjectives, and the other word types
* Optimize so that it doesn't do predicate expansion unless it actually sees a verb or adverb at the start, the only things predicate can expand to.
  * Expand this idea so it works with all expansions
* When failing to find a string, output the failing string and the partial tree
* Make output file cumulative with an explicit reset command
