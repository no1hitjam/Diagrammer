To do
=====

* Import verbs from json
  * Maybe verbs should just be one word again
  * Also, you need to create json for gerund and infinitives
* Optimize so that it doesn't do predicate expansion unless it actually sees a verb or adverb at the start, the only things predicate can expand to.
* When failing to find a string, output the failing string
